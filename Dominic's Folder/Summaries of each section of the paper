Summary of each section of 
“PERSISTENT HIGH INCIDENCE OF TUBERCULOSIS AMONG IMMIGRANTS IN A LOW-INCIDENCE COUNTRY: IMPACT OF IMMIGRANTS WITH EARLY OR LATE LATENCY“

1. Introduction
-> Characteristics of Tuberculosis(TB).
-> Overview of TB situation over the globe.
-> The development or organization of the paper.

2. Model formulation
-> Setup of the ODE systems
-> Define parameters and variables

3. Model Analysis
-> Assume there is an equilibrium, then there exists a solution for the equilibrium.
-> Prove that there exists an equilibrium of the system by setting up the Lyapunov function V(x) and proving the V’(x) < 0. Note Lyapunov [Pronouce: lee 'ap uh nahf]

4. Numerical Simulation
-> Plug in the initial data of X, E, L, T (from the 2001 Census of Canada), and others into the system. Note that most of the values of the parameters can be found in this section.

-> Simulate different scenario of q1, q2 and β with figures
	  -> 1. q1 > 0 and q2 = 0: 
       In this scenario, an increase of q1 will sharply increase the TB incidence rate within a short period of time. TB incidence is very sensitive to the percentage of new immigrants with early-stage LTBI, q1.
    -> 2. q1 = 0 and q2 > 0:
       In this scenario, the TB incidence rate increases slowly by increasing q2 during a relatively long period. This illustrates that new immigrants with late latent TB alone, though in a large proportion, can not sustain a high TB incidence level in the foreign-born population. 
    -> 3. q1>0 and q2>0
       Illustrates the relationship of TB incidence rate with varying q1 and q2 at the endemic equilibrium. 
    -> Note that: The scenario of q1=q2=0 is done by other research.	 

-> Effects of annual new immigrant level
	  -> Fix q1 = 3%, q2 = 37%.
       Simulate the change of the TB incidence by varying the annual level of new immigrants (π) 

-> Effect of the transmission coefficient
 	-> Simulate the change of the TB incidence by varying the transmission coefficient β.

5. Summary
-> Recap the organization of the paper.
-> Conclude that new immigrants in the early latent stage (q1) have a much more significant impact than those in the late latent stage (q2) on the TB incidence of the foreign-born population in an immigration country. 
=> It is of high priority to identify and treat new immigrants with early-stage LTBI.
-> Expectation on the direction of future research.
