What I have done, 
-> I went thru the 2nd paper twice
-> made some notes about the 2nd paper
-> cross referenced the data relevant to the first paper
-> Lyapunov Theory notes from Stanford

2018 TB Paper Notes

Methods, 
Hospital discharge summary, find first TB-related hospitalisation cases, which linked back to Immigration Database find the patients characteristics.

Definitions,
Landing year was defined as the year immigrants became legal PR

Limitations,
-> Page 5(16): Landing year was defined as the year immigrants became legal PR … Because immigrants could be temporary residents in Canada before immigration, individuals in this group could be hospitalised before landing.
Page 12(23)
-> Does not Manitoba (Before April 2004) and Quebec
-> does not include hospitalization for processes that were not identified initially as TB-related, but ultimately proven to be TB-related after discharge. 
-> Prelanding data may also be underestimated if there were issues related to one’s ability to pay for hospitalization. 
-> It is assumed that landed immigrants are covered by provincial insurance, except for any health care waiting period that is required by new immigrants. 
-> Temporary residents who did not become PRs are not included
-> TB can be treated in an ambulatory setting, including meas- ures such as home isolation. TB cases treated using strictly ambulatory manage- ment or cases where the ICD codes for TB were not entered in the hospital dis- charge summary are not reflected in this study. 


 
From the paper,  We know (relevant to the first paper)
-> The time to the first TB hospitalisation from the landing month
-> Characteristics (eg, age, sex, country of birth, landing year, immigrant class) of hospitalised patients
-> X_0, we may count the number of immigrants from those high risk TB countries, Table 2
-> We know that T_0 must > TB related hospitalisation cases,  -> π, we know there were about 2M ppl move to Canada during the years 
What we don’t know
-> When they were infected, i.e. E_0 and L_0
-> α, TB-caused death rate
-> The time to the first TB hospitalisation from the arriving month
-> β, transmission rate
-> ω, p, ν -> dX,dE,dL,dT,dR, 
  
Side notes:
A total of 1.6 million people died from TB worldwide in 2021
Src: https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/tuberculosis
Estimates suggest the total number of global deaths attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 is at least 3 million.

1. Check the limit of hours for the WOC program and plan it wisely.
2. Write summaries for each section of the paper.
3. Go through the paper again and go into the details of the algebra of the proof of the theorem.
4. Add the q1 q2 assumption back to the spreadsheet.

1. Planning of the Working hours
Note that, working as a research assistant and peer tutor share the 100 hours of WOC.

There are 7 more weeks to go from now to the end of the year.
6 hours at home each week for the research.  That’s 42 hours.
3 hours on Tuesday and Friday

In the mean time, about 18 (4hrs/week x 3 weeks, + 2hr/day x 3days during the exam period) hours working as peer tutor at MSAC.
That’s total 60 hours charge from WOC.

I can do more after the final exams, but let see how it goes

2. Summaries of each section of the paper are written and uploaded as another txt file and a pdf file

3. Done

4. Done, please check the updated spreadsheet.

//...Due to strict immigration policies, we assume that there are no new immigrants with active TB.//
Not sure if the policy changed or not, as far as I know, IRCC only requires immigrants to have 
a valid medical check record, issued within 1 year, before the date of entry. Therefore, some immigrants 
may land Canada with active TB, the model may need some modifications on this part.

I have to apologize as I'm having 3 midterms in these two weeks, so I didn't spend so much time on the papers.

What I did:  
1. I basically read thru the whole paper, know what each section does. I didn't go thru the details of the proof 
   of theorem in section 3.
2. For the index, I didn’t go far from what James did, I fine tuned some of the definitions of varialbes, I marked
   down the first appearance and where the details of the parameters,  I went thru every parameters mentioned in 
   the paper, but most of them, I can’t figure out how the author came up with those figures. For example, the 
   initial number of X E L T, it cited the 2011 census of Statistics Canada, however, there are many reports in that census.

3. I think it’s good to have a glossary section, links for the references with bad links in the paper, and useful resources 
   for future use
   
For the parameters, most of details of them are listed in page 9-10 of the pdf.
