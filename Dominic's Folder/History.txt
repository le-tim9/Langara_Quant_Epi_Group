1. Check the limit of hours for the WOC program and plan it wisely.
2. Write summaries for each section of the paper.
3. Go through the paper again and go into the details of the algebra of the proof of the theorem.
4. Add the q1 q2 assumption back to the spreadsheet.

1. Planning of the Working hours
Note that, working as a research assistant and peer tutor share the 100 hours of WOC.

There are 7 more weeks to go from now to the end of the year.
6 hours at home each week for the research.  That’s 42 hours.
3 hours on Tuesday and Friday

In the mean time, about 18 (4hrs/week x 3 weeks, + 2hr/day x 3days during the exam period) hours working as peer tutor at MSAC.
That’s total 60 hours charge from WOC.

I can do more after the final exams, but let see how it goes

2. Summaries of each section of the paper are written and uploaded as another txt file and a pdf file

3. Done

4. Done, please check the updated spreadsheet.

//...Due to strict immigration policies, we assume that there are no new immigrants with active TB.//
Not sure if the policy changed or not, as far as I know, IRCC only requires immigrants to have 
a valid medical check record, issued within 1 year, before the date of entry. Therefore, some immigrants 
may land Canada with active TB, the model may need some modifications on this part.

I have to apologize as I'm having 3 midterms in these two weeks, so I didn't spend so much time on the papers.

What I did:  
1. I basically read thru the whole paper, know what each section does. I didn't go thru the details of the proof 
   of theorem in section 3.
2. For the index, I didn’t go far from what James did, I fine tuned some of the definitions of varialbes, I marked
   down the first appearance and where the details of the parameters,  I went thru every parameters mentioned in 
   the paper, but most of them, I can’t figure out how the author came up with those figures. For example, the 
   initial number of X E L T, it cited the 2011 census of Statistics Canada, however, there are many reports in that census.

3. I think it’s good to have a glossary section, links for the references with bad links in the paper, and useful resources 
   for future use
   
For the parameters, most of details of them are listed in page 9-10 of the pdf.
